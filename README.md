# Multi-Layer Staged Deployment Decision Support System

The Multi-Layer Staged Deployment Decision Support System allows constellation designers to design and assess the value of flexibility in mega-constellations that use multi-layer staged deployment. It was built as part of my masters thesis on modelling and analysing the effectiveness of multi-layer staged deployment in mega-constellations.

## Live Demo

A live demo can be accessed [here](https://multi-layer-staged-deployment-dss.netlify.app/)

## Project Implementation
The project is built in JavaScript and ReactJS

## File Structure
The project has two root directories: `/public` and `/src`.
* `/public` stores publically accessible data, including icon images and index.html
* `/src` contains all of the source code; the 'brains' of the decision support system
The following directories are found in `/src`:

### `/components`

### `/css`

### `/scss`

### `/utils`
